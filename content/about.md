Software Fellowship is one of the biggest events hosted by one of the biggest national technological festival LOCUS. This year brings even bigger motivations to start our event with a bang. Students of this fellowship can expect to learn Analytical Web App with all its components. We start from the very basic barebones of programming to deploying a full fledged web application and also dive into the world of Data analytics. Happy Learning!
